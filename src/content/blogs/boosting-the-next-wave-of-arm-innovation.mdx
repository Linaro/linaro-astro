# What is Linaro Connect?

For those of you who are new to Linaro, Linaro Connect is our yearly conference where we discuss all things related to Arm-based technology.

This is where software developers, hardware engineers and business development managers all come together to share information, network, code and make decisions which influence the technology of the future. Regardless of whether you are a software developer or a business decision maker - if you care about Arm technology this is the place to be.

# Visionary keynotes from Arm, Microsoft, Qualcomm and more

The theme for Linaro Connect Lisbon 2025 is “Boosting the Next Wave of Arm Innovation”. In Linaro’s opening keynote, Linaro CTO Grant Likely will talk about which technologies Linaro is focusing on to do just that, highlighting use cases where we are tackling industry challenges through open source collaboration and standardisation. Following on from the Linaro keynote there will be two keynotes from Arm focusing on IoT and data centre, one from Microsoft on Windows on Arm and one keynote from Linux Foundation on Safety Certification.

On Thursday we will have keynotes from Qualcomm, the openEuler project, FIDO Alliance and ADLINK covering topics such as Edge AI, Deepseek, FIDO onboarding and ONELab and Arm SystemReady. On the final day of Linaro Connect, we have keynotes covering the Cyber Resilience Act and its impact on embedded development, Confidential Computing and the opportunities it presents and the energy transition in Portugal.

# Technical Sessions, BoF, Panels and Tutorials

For 2,5 days, attendees will have access to 100+ technical sessions, BoFs, panel discussions and tutorials. The conference has four tracks covering Next gen devices (Android and Windows on Arm), Cloud Computing, HPC & AI, Industrial, IoT and Edge and Community (Linux kernel, toolchain, open source). Below we have picked out some of the highlights but go here to view [the complete schedule](https://www.linaro.org/connect/schedule).

## Fireside chat with Windows on Arm ecosystem movers

Wednesday 14 May, 14:00 - 14:40, Keynote Room

Over the past few years, Linaro’s Windows Group has been working with Arm, Microsoft, Qualcomm and CIX on enabling open source projects for Windows on Arm. In 2024, the [Linaro Windows group enabled Blender](https://www.linaro.org/blog/blender-now-enabled-on-windows-on-arm/) for Windows on Arm. In this fireside chat, Linaro, Microsoft, Qualcomm and the CTO from Blender will discuss the journey to get Blender enabled - the obstacles overcome and the benefits this enablement delivers.

## Empowering Developers: The new wave of on-device AI Development.

Wednesday 14 May, 12:00-13:00, Session room 3

In this tutorial, Dileep Karpur, Staff Product Manager at Qualcomm walks through best practises for optimizing AI workloads, leveraging hardware acceleration, and utilizing industry-standard frameworks to deploy AI models efficiently on Windows on Snapdragon -powered devices. Attendees will gain insights into the AI developer workflow, from model conversion and quantization to execution and optimization, ensuring seamless performance for a wide range of AI applications.

# BoFs led by leading Arm Open Source Software Experts

We have a fantastic line up of Birds of a Feather sessions planned - featuring some of the world’s most renowned Arm software experts leading discussions around a wide range of topics.

Wednesday 14 May, 17.10-17.50

- <u>Arm64 Compute Laptops BoF</u> - challenges with Arm64 laptops and the
  ecosystem around them (Keynote room)
- <u>EBBR BoF</u> -. All topics related to EBBR (Embedded Base Boot
  Requirements) and embedded boot are welcome at this BoF. This will be an
  opportunity for people collaborating remotely on the EBBR specification to
  meet in person and determine the direction for EBBR this year (Session room 1)
- <u>Samsung and Google Pixel SoC Upstream BoF</u> - a platform to discuss the
  state of Samsung Exynos and Google Tensor SoCs and their platforms in the
  Mainline Linux Kernel. (Session room 2)

- <u>AOSP BoF</u> - An open discussion to discuss all things AOSP (Session room
  1)
- <u>Secure Data Path BoF</u> - There's an ongoing effort in the kernel to add
  support for secure or restricted memory for various use cases. In this BoF,
  use cases are discussed to determine whether it makes sense to make a full
  open source reference implementation (Session room 2)
- <u>Qualcomm Upstream BoF</u> - In this BoF, attendees will discuss state of
  Qualcomm SoCs and Platforms support in Mainline Linux Kernel (Session room 3)

## Panel discussion featuring Security Experts: Navigating the Complexities of Cybersecurity Regulations, Supply Chains and Confidential Computing

In this panel discussion, we will bring together some of our keynote speakers to discuss the challenges of navigating cybersecurity regulations, supply chains and confidential computing technologies. Expect insights from Kate Stewart (Linux Foundation), Mike Bursell (Confidential Computing Consortium), Richard Kerslake (FIDO Alliance) and Marta Rybczynska (Ygreky).

## Arm Confidential Compute Architecture open-source enablement update

Friday 16 May, 10:10 - 10:35, Keynote room

For anyone interested in Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA), make sure to check out the Linaro Connect schedule where we have lots of fantastic sessions on this topic planned. In this session, Arm provides an update on Arm CCA - the latest project enablement status, what they have learnt so far and what is coming next. This will be followed by a Arm CCA session from Linaro which will look at plans for the coming year in areas such as device assignment, memory encryption, confidential container technology, endorsement API and dynamic RIM (Realm Initial Measurement) computation.

## 32-bit Linux support now and in the future

Thursday 15 May, 12:00-12:25, Session room 2

Over the past few years, 64-bit Linux has become more widespread and can be found in Servers, PCs and even the smallest embedded Linux targets. In this session, maintainer of the Arm soc tree Arnd Bergmann gives an update on which 32-bit systems are still supported and at what point they will be phased out in future.

## Running the upstream Linux kernel and userspace on Qualcomm development boards

Wednesday 14 May, 16:30-16:55, Session room 3

In this session, Bjorn Andersson - a Linux kernel maintainer for Qualcomm SoC - talks about the importance of developers and testers being able to run the upstream Linux kernel and what is being done to extend this ability, allowing users to easily generate and run full Linux distributions on Qualcomm development boards.
