At Embedded World 2024, Linaro introduced [ONELab](https://www.linaro.org/solutions/onelab) - a solution which helps Silicon Vendors and Device Makers conduct continuous interoperability tests among different Operating Systems and Cloud Services. We are back again this year (Booth 4/501) for the commercial launch of ONELab to showcase just how powerful this tool is for ensuring your devices are interoperable and secure.

Stop by our booth to see ONELab in action as we connect it up to four partner boards: AMD kv260, Texas Instruments SK-AM62P-LP, Renesas RZ/G2L and Qualcomm RB3v2.

If you want to learn more about ONELab before stopping by our booth, check out our session “_Scaling Interoperability Testing with ONELab - Conquering the Challenges of Arm SystemReady Certification_” at the Speaker Forum on Wednesday 12 March, 13:30 in the Forum in Hall 3.

## What problems does ONELab address?

The number of connected devices continues to grow at an unprecedented rate, as does the complexity at which these devices operate. Latency, power consumption, cost, privacy constraints and data volume are all factors which require edge devices to process data closer to their source. Rapid prototyping and continuous improvement have become critical to ensuring operational efficiency.

ONELab helps address these challenges by providing Silicon Vendors (SiPs) and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) with a platform to continuously test interoperability with operating systems and cloud services, ensuring readiness for cloud-native edge deployments. Through ONELab, users can:

- Streamline the testing and Arm SystemReady-DT (devicetree) and PSA Certified certification process, allowing them to effortlessly verify hardware and software compatibility.
- Identify issues early by addressing compatibility concerns throughout the development process, avoiding costly setbacks later on.
- Provide evidence to their customers that their products are cloud-native edge-ready and will just work.

## Interested to learn more?

Make sure to stop by our booth 4/501 to learn more about ONELab and the services we provide to help you streamline your IoT and Edge device testing. Alternatively visit our [ONELab website](https://www.linaro.org/solutions/onelab) or [get in touch here](https://www.linaro.org/contact).

We hope to see you at Embedded World!
