### About These Tools


Building and testing the Linux kernel across dozens of architectures, compilers, and configurations is complex. Linaro created a set of tools to make that process reproducible and accessible:
  - **Tuxmake** simplifies kernel builds with a single command, handling cross-compilation toolchains and build configurations automatically

\- **TuxRun** executes kernel boot and functional tests across multiple architectures using QEMU

\- **TuxLava** integrates these capabilities with LAVA test infrastructure

   Together, they form the foundation of modern kernel CI workflows.
