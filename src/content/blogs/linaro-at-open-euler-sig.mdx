title: "Linaro at openEuler SIG Gathering 2024"
description: >
  The openEuler Special Interest Group (SIG) Gathering was held in Beijing on July 26th 2024. This was the first event of this type for the openEuler community. There were around 300 developers in the conference, discussing the next stage plan for openEuler community. The topics were divided into 6 tracks: Diversity Computing Power, AI Native support, Full-Scenario Application, openEuler Native development, Upstream Native Support and User experience Research. In this blog, we will look at some of the highlights from this event.

The openEuler Special Interest Group (SIG) Gathering was held in Beijing on July 26th 2024. This was the first event of this type for the openEuler community. There were around 300 developers in the conference, discussing the next stage plan for openEuler community. The topics were divided into 6 tracks: Diversity Computing Power, AI Native support, Full-Scenario Application, openEuler Native development, Upstream Native Support and User experience Research. In this blog, we will look at some of the highlights from this event.

There were fruitful discussions on the hardware verification regulation and Kernel CI enhancement for openEuler in the Diversity Computing Power track, as well as the collaboration efforts for Apache Bigtop and Lustre upstream support in the Upstream Native Support track. Linaro has shared 3 topics of our work in openEuler and actively engaged with the discussion.

As the openeuler Arm-SIG maintainer, Kevin Zhao is serving as the producer of the Diversity Computing Power track, leading the discussion between multiple SIG groups including Kernel SIG, Intel Arch SIG, Arm SIG, RISC-V SIG, etc. This track discussed how to enhance openEuler's support for the latest platforms of various mainstream architectures. The participants proposed a concept of diversity computing power certification, shared some performance optimizations and user cases, and also looked ahead to discuss the user scenarios of Arm Confidential Compute Architecture (Arm CCA) technology. As a new feature for Arm V9, Arm CCA has attracted a lot of attention in the discussion and several silicon vendors shared their interests in their product adoption and end to end solution design for this security enhancement.

Guodong Xu from Linaro/HiSilicon Landing Team and Xinliang Liu from the Linaro Data Center Group joined the Upstream Native Support track. This track focused primarily on the support of key technical features of openEuler by upstream communities such as the Linux kernel, compiler, big data components, storage, etc. Guodong shared the Big Data SIG achievements: Apache Bigtop 3.3.0 has native support for openEuler, and also Big Data SIG has incubated the Bigtop-manager as a sub-project inside of Apache Bigtop. Next, they will continue to promote the openEuler 24.03-LTS support for Bigtop, and touch optimization works on every aspect of Big Data components for Arm Aarch64 ecosystem.

Xinliang shared the Lustre on openEuler enablement and releases status. He has also shared the work for setting up the Lustre Arm64 CI and the next stage release plan for openEuler 24.03 LTS. Lustre on openEuler 22.03 LTS has been released following the distro release cycle and we are also working on porting Lustre to openEuler 20.03 LTS, as this version is still widely used in some verticals, such as HPC environments, that have relatively conservative evolution strategies.

openEuler and Linaro collaboration
OpenAtom openEuler (openEuler for short) is an open source project incubated and operated by the OpenAtom Foundation. OpenEuler now has taken about 36.8% Chinese market share in 2023 and is increasing very quickly worldwide. Linaro signed the CLA to join the OpenAtom openEuler community in 2021. The two parties have engaged in deep cooperation in several key technical areas of Arm servers, achieving significant achievements in standardization, data storage, big data, Arm confidential computing, and User Space Accelerators (UADK). Linaro's international influence has brought a broader vision and deeper international cooperation opportunities to the openEuler community, accelerating the internationalization of openEuler.

Conclusion
The openEuler SIG Gathering has raised a good development discussion for the openEuler community. Some concrete ideas have been made to guide the next half year's upstream development. For more information of Linaro and openEuler collaboration, please take a look at some following links:
