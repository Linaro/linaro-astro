We’re excited to announce the release of the [WindowsPerf Visual Studio Extension v1.0.0](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension/-/releases/v1.0.0), our first stable release after the beta. This version supports most of the available features related to sampling that are currently available on [WindowsPerf 3.3.0](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/releases) and brings new features, improvements, and bug fixes. The minimum required version of WindowsPerf for the extension to run is version 3.3.0 onwards.

This Linaro [open-source project](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension) is available for [download](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension/-/releases/v1.0.0) - to get started with the extension you can follow the guides on our detailed [documentation wiki](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension/-/wikis/home). The new sampling feature, built on [WindowsPerf’s sampling model](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/tree/main/wperf?ref_type=heads#sampling-model), allows for detailed performance analysis and displays hot spots in a process, helping developers target and rectify performance bottlenecks. Users can easily navigate through this feature in the familiar [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) environment.

# What is WindowsPerf?
[WindowsPerf](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/) is a (Linux perf inspired) lightweight Windows on Arm performance profiling tool. Profiling is based on ARM64 PMU (Performance Monitor Unit) and its hardware counters.

# What’s New
## Improved Sampling Settings

* Added support for selecting multiple events per run, allowing users to sample all selected events simultaneously.
* Introduced support for project target payloads. When opening the Sampling Explorer settings, users can now select the current project build target (Debug | Release, arm64, arm64ec, etc.), and the extension will automatically launch the built resource from that configuration.
* To address the large list of events, we've added an autocomplete component that helps filter down the list of events in the selection input.
* Realigned the command preview to match [WindowsPerf 3.3.0](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/windowsperf/-/releases) version.

## Disassembly Features

![Disassembly output](/linaro-website/images/blog/windowsperf-image3_exytus.png)

* Added disassembly output from sampling runs to the Sampling Explorer widget, providing users with the opportunity to dive deeper into the most frequently executed instructions.
* Enhanced the editor by adding line highlighting to better identify hotspots directly in the codebase.
* Improved the percentage display in the Sampling Explorer table.

# Fixes
* Fixed typos, alignment issues, and errors in form validation.
* Improved the stability of the tool, especially the Sampling Explorer and search features.

# Docs and Community
* Updated our documentation and added new tutorials and videos. Check out the new docs on our [Wiki page](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension/-/wikis/home).

We hope you enjoy the new features and improvements! You can find out more by visiting [our repository](https://gitlab.com/Linaro/WindowsPerf/vs-extension). We’re always looking to make things better, so your feedback through issues or merge requests is always welcome.
