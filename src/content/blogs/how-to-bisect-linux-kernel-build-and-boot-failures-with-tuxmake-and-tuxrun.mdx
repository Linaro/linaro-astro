title: How to bisect Linux Kernel build and boot failures with TuxMake and TuxRun
description: >-
  In our previous blog post we looked at why kernel bisection is tricky to
  perform today.

  The short version is simple.

  If the environment changes while git walks through history, the bisect result cannot be trusted.


  This post shows one way to keep the environment stable while bisecting.

  The focus is not on speed or clever tricks.

  It is about getting the same answer every time.

## What this approach is trying to solve

When a regression is reported by CI or an individual contributor, it usually comes with context, such as:

* An architecture
* A Compiler version 
* A kernel configuration 
* For boot or test regressions, a device 
* Sometimes a specific test

The information describes the environment where the regression was seen. The  problem is that this context is often incomplete or hard to reproduce locally.

[TuxMake](https://tuxmake.org/) and [TuxRun](https://tuxrun.org/) are open source tools created by Linaro which are [part if the Kerncel CI project, ](https://www.linaro.org/blog/linaro-transfers-kernel-building-and-testing-tools-to-the-kernelci-project/)currently powering its build and test pipelines. The tools are used to build, boot, and test Linux kernels in a reproducible way. They help by making the build and test environment part of the command itself. 

That command can then be used directly with git bisect run.
