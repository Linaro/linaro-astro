*Madrid, Spain; [Tuesday 14 May]*  Linaro Limited, the leading engineering organization driving innovation in the Arm ecosystem, unveiled its new brand today. The company will still to be known as Linaro and continue its mission to accelerate deployment of Arm-based solutions.
Linaro is known for driving open source collaboration in the Arm software ecosystem. In recent years, the company has diversified and today also provides consultancy services, training, software platforms and development tools. Times and tastes change and so has Linaro - the time has come to reflect that in the company’s look and feel.

Collaboration is a partnership, a continuous process. It has always played an integral part in how Linaro operates and as such, the new logo needed to convey the concept of continuous collaboration. This is why the central symbol in Linaro’s new logo recalls the infinity shape. The symbol not only conveys the concept of collaboration and the end-to-end support Linaro provides its customers, but also reflects the nature of working with Linaro - a collaborative relationship that develops harmoniously and organically. 

Just as the infinite symbol suggests limitless possibilities and endless potential, Linaro embraces the ever-changing nature of the tech industry. The symbol embodies the spirit of perpetual progress, symbolizing Linaro’s dedication to pushing boundaries, fostering collaboration, and driving advancements that shape the future of computing. With a focus on openness, flexibility, and adaptability, the infinite symbol captures Linaro’s ethos of constant growth, transformation, and exploration in the pursuit of excellence.

Moreover, the logo subtly resembles a pair of goggles, symbolizing our visionary approach to looking ahead. With these “goggles,” we gain a clearer perspective on the future of the Arm ecosystem, enabling us to anticipate trends, identify opportunities, and navigate challenges with clarity and foresight.

*"Linaro has always led the way in open source collaboration in the Arm ecosystem, but today the company goes far beyond that”*, said Li Gong, Linaro CEO. *“Linaro now provides consultancy, training and a range of innovative products, enabling our partners to drive forward development more rapidly and effectively then ever before. Linaro has evolved and it is time our brand reflects the exciting and dynamic company we have become.”*
