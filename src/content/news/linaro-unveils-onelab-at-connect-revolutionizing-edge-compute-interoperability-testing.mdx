Linaro Connect, [Location] – [Date] – Linaro, the leading engineering organization driving innovation in the Arm ecosystem, today announced the launch of ONELab, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at revolutionizing interoperability testing for Edge and IoT devices. The announcement was made during the second day of the Linaro Connect conference, representing a significant milestone in addressing the challenges of cloud-native edge computing.

In today's rapidly evolving digital landscape, the demand for sophisticated edge compute solutions has never been higher. The proliferation of connected devices, coupled with the need for efficient data processing closer to its source, has underscored the importance of interoperability testing in ensuring seamless deployment of cloud-native edge solutions.

ONELab, Linaro's innovative interoperability testing platform, provides a collaborative 
environment for Silicon Vendors (SiPs) and Original Design Manufacturers (ODMs) to validate hardware and software compatibility with operating systems and cloud services. The platform streamlines the testing process, significantly reducing time-to-market and minimizing risks associated with compatibility issues.

"We are excited to unveil ONELab at Linaro Connect, the most important conference for the Arm ecosystem," said [Spokesperson], [Title] at Linaro. "ONELab represents a significant step towards overcoming the challenges of cloud-native edge computing. By fostering collaboration and interoperability testing, we aim to create a more secure, efficient, and scalable ecosystem for Edge and IoT devices."

The launch of ONELab has already garnered strong support from industry leaders, with ADLINK, AMD, Arm, Bosch Software and Digital Solutions, Qualcomm, Renesas, Red Hat, Texas Instruments among the supporting partners.


QUALCOMM

>“Qualcomm is thrilled to bring RB2 Edge Compute platform to ONELab towards continuous testing/integration of Open-source OSs/Upstream ?Kernel and ARM Syste-Ready-IR test suite. This paves the way for host of other IoT Edge Compute platforms such as RB1, RB3, RB5, RB3Gen2 ?>and RB5Gen2.”
