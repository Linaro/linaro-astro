Nuremberg, Germany – [Mar, 11th 2025] – Linaro, the leading engineering organization driving innovation in the Arm® ecosystem, proudly announces the commercial launch of ONELab, the industry’s most comprehensive testing platform for IoT and Edge devices. The announcement is made at Embedded World 2025, reinforcing ONELab’s pivotal role in shaping the future of connected devices.

The IoT and Edge industries are at a crucial point, where innovation must be met with reliability, security, and interoperability. ONELab is the solution the industry needs to confidently build the next generation of IoT & Edge devices.

By providing a unified and robust testing framework, ONELab eliminates fragmentation and ensures seamless interoperability across the ecosystem. ONELab provides highly-efficient remote and automated continuous compliance testing of devices and firmware to the latest version of the Arm SystemReady™Devicetree interoperability specification and test suite for vendors, ODMs and ISVs.

“With ONELab's deep and broad range of interoperability testing, ODM's can now validate and deliver support for a wide range of software stacks in one single cohesive platform, enabling them to support more customers, and lower cost, and faster time to market." said Grant Likely, CTO at Linaro.

“AMD has supported Linaro’s ONELab initiative to drive greater standardization within the embedded software ecosystem since its inception,” said Simon George, Director, Embedded Software, AMD. “We believe that open source is the way to accelerate innovation, so assisting developers to integrate technologies from different projects and vendors is a positive step forward.”

“The rapid evolution of IoT and edge computing requires continuous security validation and interoperability across increasingly complex multi-vendor software stacks,” said Mark Hambleton, SVP Software at Arm. “The commercial launch of ONELab will advance Arm SystemReady compliance, enabling a new standard for connected device reliability and scalability across the Arm ecosystem, building trust and accelerating IoT innovation.”

“We are thrilled to deepen our cooperation with Linaro through ONELab. By collaborating with Linaro, ADLINK is empowering faster time-to-market for our OSM and SMARC modules while ensuring seamless interoperability across the Arm ecosystem and up-to-date security.” said Henri Parmentier, Senior Product Manager, Computer on Modules BU, ADLINK Technology. “This partnership reflects our commitment to driving standardization and delivering secure, cutting-edge solutions that meet the evolving demands of the embedded computing landscape" he added.

"This innovative collaborative initiative aims to deliver scalable interoperability for Arm-based IoT and edge devices, addressing a vital industry need," stated Mohammed Dogar, Vice President of Embedded Processing Business Acceleration Division at Renesas. "Renesas is honored to join ONELab as a lead partner, utilizing our RZ MPUs to support this crucial effort. Our collaboration highlights our commitment to advancing technology and ensuring seamless integration across various platforms. This initiative will greatly enhance the development and deployment of IoT and edge devices, driving innovation and efficiency within the industry."

ONELab also serves as an important bridge to the recently announced Cyber Resilience Act (CRA), enabling manufacturers to proactively meet regulatory requirements and enhance the security and longevity of their devices. By leveraging ONELab, ODMs mitigate the risks associated with isolated, vendor-specific testing environments, ensuring that companies are not left maintaining their devices alone.

The journey to the next generation of IoT & Edge devices demands a paradigm shift in how products are tested, validated, and maintained. ONELab is not just a tool, it is a critical enabler of the future, helping the industry take the next leap forward.
