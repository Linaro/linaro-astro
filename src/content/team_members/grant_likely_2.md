Grant Likely is a Linux kernel developer and maintainer of the Device Tree subsystem. Grant's first involvement with Linux development was back in 2004 while working on an embedded system. Linux didn't support his platform, so after he got Linux to boot, he posted his changes publicly and got them merged into mainline. Since then, he has been actively involved in improving the state of embedded Linux and has worked with many different embedded systems. Currently, Grant chairs the Linux Foundation's Technical Advisory Board and is a Fellow at Linaro.
