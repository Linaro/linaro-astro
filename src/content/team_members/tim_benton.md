Tim has over 30 years experience in Software Engineering in a variety of roles and companies, with phone and embedded being a strong theme throughout. After university, Tim worked in several startups before picking one (STNC) that was bought by Microsoft, where he spent 12 years in both the UK and US, leading teams and working closely with OEM and Mobile Operator partners to bring up and ship new hardware. After a stint in consulting building IoT solutions and helping companies turn around their engineering teams, Tim moved to Arm in 2017 where, as Senior Director of the Open Source Software Group, he was responsible for the 250 engineers in that team, and worked closely with Linaro on various projects and as a committee member. In 2020 Tim led several teams at Facebook tackling some of the key platform initiatives in the integrity space. Tim has a keen interest in how to manage teams and build software efficiently - and how different companies achieve this.
