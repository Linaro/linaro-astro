Jonathan leads the ARM server kernel team at Huawei Technologies Research & Development (UK) Ltd. based in Cambridge, UK. The UK team works alongside ARM64 Solutions within HiSilicon, to provide upstream kernel support for Kunpeng server SoCs. A recent personal focus has been on CCIX, taking an active role in the CCIX Consortiumâ€™s TSC, SW and Protocol working groups. Jonathan has a PhD in Information Engineering from Cambridge University. It was there, during a Post Doc on wireless sensor platforms, that he first encountered the upstream kernel and he subsequently developed the IIO kernel subsystem which he has now maintained for 10+ years. He takes a particular interest in encouraging new contributors to the upstream kernel.
