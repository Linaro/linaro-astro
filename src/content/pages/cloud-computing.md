            text: Big Data and Data Science technologies play a vital role in enabling businesses to become more efficient and succesful. This project focuses on the engineering activities Linaro is driving in this area, focusing specifically on ARMv8 builds for Apache BigTop, Ambari, Spark and Hadoop.
          - title: System Ready Compliant Platform Collaboration
            text: This project focuses on Server Standardisation. This involves working on architectures such as SBSA and xBBR to enable simplified adoption of mainline builds on new server hardware.
          - title: Enhance Software-Defined-Storage on Arm Servers
            text: There is a shift towards using all-flash storage solutions (SSD/NVME) as opposed to traditional HDD disks due to improvements in performance. The goal of this project is to collaborate with industry leaders in the Arm server ecosystem so that we can provide competitive and leading storage solutions with Arm servers.
          - title: Deploy CCA on Arm platforms
            text: Confidential computing is a security and privacy-enhancing computational technique focused on protecting data in use. Armâ€™s solution for this is specified in the Confidential Computing Architecture (CCA) which only looks at hardware and system software. This project fills the gap by focusing on lower level bits, as well as the user space and higher level applications.
