            title: Managing vast amounts of data securely while maintaining consistent data integrity is no small feat
            text_content: |
              In today's enterprise landscape, innovation is driven by the need for robust security, seamless scalability, and efficient data management. Companies are sitting on a wealth of data, but scaling it securely and efficiently presents major obstacles. Are you struggling with inconsistent data access reliability? Is it a challenge to unify scattered data sources? Do you face roadblocks trying to protect your distributed environments and valuable data?

              Keep your data secure and compliant with Linaro’s end-to-end solution supporting Confidential Computing on Arm
            longDescription: |
              Securing distributed data against sophisticated cyberattacks or the constant threat of ransomware and phishing is becoming increasingly more difficult and expensive. For enterprises who are governed by regulatory frameworks such as ISO 27001, there is the added challenge of continually maintaining and demonstrating compliance across vast volumes of sensitive data in distributed environments. 

              Confidential Computing helps secure your data in the cloud by using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs). TEEs create a secure, verifiable execution environment that keeps your workload and sensitive data away from prying eyes while preventing the loss of data integrity and theft of intellectual property. As a result, the attack surface is minimized and the likelihood of internal attacks reduced.

              Linaro provides an end-to-end confidential computing solution for Arm platforms that is built entirely on open source software.  We follow industry standards and specifications to provide answers to confidential computing's complex requirements, from host platform support to independent verification security claims.

              We have helped silicon vendors such as Fujitsu emulate confidential computing environments using our QEMU-based emulation solution, with a comprehensive software stack that covers host and confidential guest firmwares and Linux kernels that allowed them to test their customers’ workloads before the real hardware is available. Moreover, our Arm SystemReady compliant solution guarantees that the same software stack will run on real hardware when it becomes available.

              Linaro’s verification service, available in Software as a Service or under licensing agreements, can attest to evidence generated by both the hardware and the software stack, one of the very few services in the market that can accomplish this today. We are also one of the only companies that provides a verification service that is fully based on open source projects, making it easily auditable and verifiable by anyone. Not only is Linaro’s verification service compliant with the latest attestation standards from IETF, we actively participate in the development of the standards.

              Linaro's commercial support on both our reference software stack and verification service delivers security and stability for your customers adopting Confidential Computing, and peace of mind for you.

              Securely store your data and ensure quality through Linaro’s experience in Big Data
            longDescription: |
              Generating high-quality, real-time data is a complex task, particularly when your architecture bridges the gap between diverse SaaS platforms, CRMs, and custom-built solutions. Big Data and storage framework projects are specifically designed to streamline these integrations, giving you peace of mind that your data is not only reliable and accessible, but also useful and providing you the insights your business needs to differentiate from the competition.

              Linaro has vast experience in the Big Data area, having contributed to various Apache Big Data projects (Hadoop, Spark, Drill, NiFi, Kafka, Pulsar, Kudu, Airflow, Parquet, Impala, Beam, Thrift, Hive, Ranger, Flink, HBase, Arrow, Knox, Avro, Ozone, and Doris), both porting them to Arm and enhancing their execution performance. We also created and maintain Bigtop Manager. Linaro has actively participated in multiple Bigtop releases since version 1.3. More recently we have been working on Gluten and Velox integration into Apache Big Data projects to improve their performance on Arm.

              While harnessing Big Data & Data Science projects, Linaro also take care of where the data is stored. We engage with numerous storage framework projects (Rook, Ceph, Mayastor, Lustre, ZFS, BeeGFS, DAOS, SDPK, JuiceFS). We port them to Arm, maintain their Continuous Integration with the community, and enhance their execution performance.

              If your company is having performance issues with Big Data and storage frameworks, Linaro is in a unique position to help you out. If you want to migrate your workloads to Arm and don’t know where to start, we are here to guide you. The expertise Linaro has built over the years in porting and enhancing the performance of Big Data and storage framework open source projects can be applied not only to other projects in the same areas, but also to any open source or closed source application your company relies on. Linaro has successfully helped ISVs port their applications to Arm and make them more performant than in other platforms.

              Leverage Linaro’s toolchain expertise to optimize your HPC performance
            longDescription: |
              Linaro is working with Fujitsu to maximise system performance on their next generation processor: FUJITSU-MONAKA. The goal is to improve the support for the Fortran compiler and optimize libraries to the Arm64 architecture so they have better performance on the future platform.

              Linaro has also worked on performance optimization of many projects, both open source (Big Data, storage, cryptography) and close source ISV solutions. Measuring through benchmarks and developing the changes needed to enhance the performance is one of our core skills. Be it through vectorization of algorithms, or through deep analysis of algorithms and how they map in the hardware (memory alignments, cache line sizes, etc.), we can help improve the performance of your critical applications.

              Achieve scale and performance through cloud migration with Linaro
            longDescription: |
              In recent years, there has been a shift towards adopting Arm servers. While cloud-native companies can easily adopt Arm processors like Graviton and Neoverse, the path for legacy x86 applications is less straightforward. To leverage Arm's processing power, these organizations typically have three choices:

                - Move to Arm using emulation 

                - Port part of the code, manually rewriting key application segments to avoid emulation bottlenecks

                - Work with Linaro to optimize your codebase and ensure a smooth migration

                - Linaro can apply its deep expertise on porting and optimizing source code to help your company migrate to the cloud without any hiccups.
