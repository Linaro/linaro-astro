title: Linux and Open Source Engineering Training for Modern Systems
description: |
  Modern Linux-based and open source systems are built on fast-moving foundations. Teams that rely on ad-hoc learning, outdated material, or trial-and-error often pay for it later—in rework, fragile designs, and long-term maintenance cost. Linaro provides engineer-focused Linux and open source training to help teams make better technical decisions earlier, understand real trade-offs in the stack, and work more effectively with the ecosystems they depend on. Linaro brings deep experience in Arm-based systems, reflecting its long-standing role in advancing Linux and open source software across the Arm ecosystem—from embedded devices to servers.

            title: Upstream-Aware Linux Training
            text_content: |
              Many long-term problems in Linux systems stem from decisions made early—often without a clear understanding of upstream communities or long-term ownership cost.

              Linaro training takes an upstream-aware approach:

                - Why avoiding unnecessary forks usually reduces cost
                - How upstream collaboration improves long-term maintainability
                - Where customization helps—and where it quietly creates risk
                - How to make changes that survive kernel and platform evolution

              Upstream contribution is not required. But understanding how upstream works leads to better outcomes, even when contribution is not the immediate goal.

              **Build systems & integration**

              Toolchains, build workflows, reproducibility, and long-term maintainability

              **Firmware & boot software**

              Boot flows, early platform bring-up, and secure initialization

              **Linux kernel & system software**

              Kernel architecture, drivers, device trees, debugging, and upstream practices

              **Security foundations**

              Platform security concepts, trusted execution, and secure system design
