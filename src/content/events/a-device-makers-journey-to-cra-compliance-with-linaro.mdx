Abstract : The EU Cyber Resilience Act (CRA) is redefining how connected devices are built, shipped, and maintained. Compliance is not a single checklist item; it is an organisational shift that reshapes product roadmaps, legacy portfolios, and long‑term strategy.

In this webinar, we walk you through a **realistic CRA compliance journey for a typical device maker**, based on Linaro’s hands‑on experience advising embedded device manufacturers on CRA compliance. You will be provided with an overview of how to:

    - **Decode the CRA** - Understand the core requirements and the areas most organisations tend to underestimate.

    - **Audit your portfolio** - Identify which products are already on a good pathway to becoming compliant, which need remediation, and which may no longer be viable.

    - **Navigate tough scenarios** - Manage fielded devices, in‑development projects, and legacy designs that were not built with today’s security expectations.

    - **Avoid common pitfalls** - Tackle challenges such as software‑supply‑chain vulnerability tracking and the gap between policy and engineering reality.

    - **Leverage integrated expertise** - See how Linaro’s technical and legal specialists collaborate to analyse issues, design compliant processes, and provide tailored solutions (including custom tooling) that can be woven into existing development workflows.

Designed for product managers, engineers, and security leaders, this session delivers a clear, actionable roadmap that balances risk, cost, and long‑term product strategy while reflecting the real challenges and practical solutions experienced by device makers today.
