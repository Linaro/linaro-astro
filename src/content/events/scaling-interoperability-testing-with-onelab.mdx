Ensuring interoperability in the embedded ecosystem is a complex challenge. With a wide range of possible OS choices‚Äîincluding SoC vendor OSes, ODM-specific builds, OEM enterprise OSes, and third-party distributions‚Äîembedded devices must be continuously tested for compatibility across multiple environments.

The ONELab platform, recently launched at Embedded World 2025, addresses this challenge by providing a continuous compliance testing service for Arm SystemReady-Devicetree (DT). It brings together devices, OS images, test suites, and workloads to ensure that firmware implementations meet the Embedded Base Boot Requirements (EBBR) and the Devicetree Specification while aligning with the SystemReady Compliance System Requirements Specification.

By leveraging ONELab, developers and manufacturers can:

- Reduce custom engineering efforts in the software supply chain.
- Ensure standard Linux distributions work out of the box on embedded platforms.
- Eliminate the struggle of firmware and OS compatibility.
- Enable regression testing to validate firmware updates.
- Reassure customers that OS updates will function as expected.

Join this webinar to learn how ONELab is revolutionizing embedded device testing and making interoperability at scale a reality.
