title: "Google training: Upstream Kernel Development (delivered by Linaro)"
description: >-
  Upstream Kernel Development shows trainees how to contribute to the Linux
  kernel. This includes understanding the role of kernel maintainers, how to
  best align their work with the Linux release schedule, how to handle feedback
  and what to do if things don’t go to plan.


  This course covers the “social” aspects of upstream kernel development. It is best suited to trainees who understand how to write kernel drivers but have not previously worked alongside the wider kernel community. Trainees will learn how to confidently participate in upstream kernel development and, in particular, how to contribute new kernel drivers.
